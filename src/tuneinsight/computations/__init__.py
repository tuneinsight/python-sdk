# Running computations

This module defines classes to create and run computations on a Tune Insight instance,
as well as get and analyze the results from computations.

## The `Computation` architecture

The core class defined by this module is `Computation`, which interfaces with
the API bindings to run computations and get their results. All computations are
created and parameterized via their constructor method:

```python
    computation = ComputationClass(project, **additional_parameters)
```

This also sets the computation on the `project`, and broadcasts it to all other
project participants. Running a computation on the project is done with the `.run`
method (and its key parameter `local`):

```python
    result = computation.run(local=False)
```

Specific computations inherit from the base `Computation` class, and provide high-level
pre-processing of arguments, high-level post-processing of results, and additional methods
to visualize results.

This module also defines high-level classes to interface with policies, data queries,
and preprocessing (which are shared by all computations).

## Importing computations

All computation classes are available from the `tuneinsight.computations` module directly.
For instance, to create an `Aggregation` computation, use

```python
from tuneinsight.computations import Aggregation
```
