    Computes the mean and standard deviation of a list of numbers without outliers.

    This computation operates in three stages:
        1. the mean and standard deviation are computed collectively,
        2. outliers are removed from each local dataset,
        3. the mean of the remaining samples is computed collectively.

    A value is marked as an outlier if it is more than a threshold (default 2) times
    the standard deviation away from the mean.

    Optionally, the data can be divided into groups, defined by the value of the
    record in a set of columns (defined by `grouping_keys`). In this case, a mean
    value is computed for each group (combination of values for grouping columns).

    This computation assumes that the dataset has a participant column (identified by
    the `participant` parameter) that contains the source of each data sample. Only
    one record per participant and per group is used for the computation.
